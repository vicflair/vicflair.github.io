# Guide to learning foreign languages
Based on my experience learning (to various levels) French, German, Dutch, Italian, and Chinese.

## Some guides
- [LifeHacker - "I Learned to Speak Four Languages in a Few Years: Here's How"](http://goo.gl/CILJM)
- [Learn Any Language - "10000 sentences"](http://goo.gl/4Nqbs1)

## Web resources
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com): Probably the most well-known, and more or less effective, automatic translation tool. Available on the web or on your phone (with downloadable language packs for offline use). 
- [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com): Practice translating, listening, and even speaking (still a little rough) in a game.
- [Mondley](http://www.mondlylanguages.com): Another language learning game site. Integrates nice audio and visuals.
- [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com): Create your own or use others' flashcard decks. Learn using a spaced repetition system (SRS), audio, and helpful mnemonics. Great for vocabulary!
- [BliuBliu](http://www.bliubliu.com): Learn using foreign language videos, text, stories at your level.
- [Lingua.ly](https://lingua.ly): Learn new words using snippets of news and magazines. You can even add words to learn from any internet page using a browser extension.
- [Word Reference](http://www.wordreference.com): One of the best dictionaries and forums for English, French, Spanish, and Italian. Includes comprehensive definitions, pronunciations, and conjugations.
- [Forvo](http://www.forvo.com): An "audio dictionary" so you can hear how words sound like as spoken by native speakers.
- [Lang-8](http://www.lang-8.com): A language exchange and social network where you correct texts written by people learning your native language, and native speakers correct your texts written in their language.
- [Linguee](http://www.linguee.com): An online multi-language dictionary which not only shows you definitions, but also text snippets from the web so you can understand the context for word or phrase usage.
- [LingQ](http://www.lingq.com): A vocabulary building website that allows you to choose words to focus on learning. Unfortunately, most good features are not free.
- [Wiki: international phonetic alphabet](https://goo.gl/y86e3p): The Wikipedia entry on the international phonetic alphabet (IPA). Useful reference for learning a system to master pronunciation and improve your own listening abilities.
- [Fluent in 3 months](http://www.fluentin3months.com): Benny Lewis' site where he documents his own language learning experiences and provides advice to others who want to do the same. I think he has a very fun, positive, and practical attitude towards foreign languages.
- [WeSpeke](http://www.wespeke.com): Practice speaking with native speakers from around the world.
- [Verbling](http://www.verbling.com): Get online tutoring from native speakers.
- [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com): Online encyclopedia of writing systems and languages. I like this site for getting an "academic" overview of a language, including its orthography and phonetics.
- [Learn Any Language](http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/): Wiki community for sharing language tips
- [Wiktionary](http://www.wiktionary.org): Great multi-language online dictionary (and partial thesaurus) which has pronunciation, usage, etymology, pronunciation (audio and IPA), conjugations/declensions, derived terms, etc.

## Apps
- App versions of web resources
- [Semper](https://goo.gl/FP6qZn): Learn while unlocking your phone. I actually find that "micro-learning" really helps. Sometimes consistent exposure and little effort can go a long way.
- [Anki](https://www.ankiapp.com/): Programmable flashcards. A little complicated at first, but you can just download other peoples' flashcard decks. 

### French specific
- [French.About.com](http://french.about.com)
- [Assimil - Using French](http://goo.gl/s6ibsk)

### Dutch specific
- [Hear Dutch Here](http://www.heardutchhere.com)
- [Assimil - Dutch with Ease](http://goo.gl/u4Ylcg)

## Other useful things to have
- A pocket phrasebook
- An audio course that you can listen to while biking, e.g. [Pimsleur](http://www.pimsleur.com) or [Michel Thomas](http://www.michelthomas.com). I haven't used Pimsleur, but I highly recommend the Michel Thomas courses. They take you into the language slowly and gently, but in my opinion, rather effectively. Great for getting some speaking practice and building an intuition of the language.
- A visual or picture dictionary, e.g. [Oxford Picture Dictionary](http://goo.gl/M12xQu)

## General Tips
- Watch news, movies, television shows in target languages
- Start with media for children
- Learn by listening to, translating, and memorizing foreign language songs
- Learn pronunciation and orthography first
- Audiobooks! Learn while walking, biking, etc.
- Carry a small book with you to learn in your spare minutes
- Ladder languages: use one language to learn another
- Get a tandem or language exchange partner
